# AlphaMissenseViewer

AlphaMissenseViewer is designed to allow the rapid searching of the AlphaMissense_hg19.tsv or AlphaMissense_hg38.tsv files for the data for specific mutations or are possible variants in a gene or transcript. The search function works by performing a [binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm) on the data file. To do this the file must be decompressed using a program like 7zip or Windows 11's decompression function. To search for possible variants in a gene or transcrip, the file most first be indexed using the program's Index function.
