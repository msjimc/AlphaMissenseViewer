# Download
This folder contains the precompiled program and dll files as both individual files and a zip file. Due to heightened security by some organisation's IT departments it may not be possible to run a program extracted from a zip file. Consequently, you may have to try downloading the program both ways and move the program to a new location before the program runs!

#### Important notes  

Once downloaded it is important that the AgileONTHaplotyper.exe and BamReaderdll.dll are located in the same folder.  

The images show the process for downloading AgileStructure, but the process is the same.
